Table Tennis Trainer â€“ AI-Powered Table Tennis Ball Detection and Analytics
Overview
Table Tennis Trainer is an AI-driven system designed to analyze table tennis gameplay videos by detecting and tracking the ball automatically. Using computer vision techniques combined with cloud-based model inference, the system provides detailed ball position, trajectory information, and performance metrics to help players improve their skills through data-driven insights.

Features
Automatic frame-by-frame detection of table tennis balls in uploaded gameplay videos using the Roboflow object detection API.

Traditional computer vision fallback for ball tracking via color segmentation, contour detection, and trajectory mapping.

Video overlays displaying detected ball locations, trajectories, and key metrics such as speed and spin estimation.

Modular and extensible codebase facilitating future enhancements like advanced analytics and educational content.

Supports analysis of personal practice or match videos to provide actionable performance feedback.

Technologies Used
Python 3.9+

OpenCV (computer vision and image processing)

Roboflow API (AI-powered object detection)

NumPy and Pandas (data handling)

JSON for storing detection outputs

How It Works
Upload a video of table tennis gameplay.

The system sends the video frames to the Roboflow API to detect the position of the ball in each frame.

Detection results are processed locally to:

Extract ball coordinates and confidence scores.

Generate an overlay video showing bounding boxes, trajectories, and metrics.

Users can review the annotated video to analyze their shots, ball control, and play style.

Installation
Ensure Python 3.9 or above is installed.

Install required dependencies:

text
pip install -r requirements.txt
Obtain a Roboflow API key and configure it in the project as needed.

Usage
Run the main program (e.g., through the script that handles video processing and visualization).

Upload your table tennis gameplay video.

Let the system process the video to produce ball tracking data.

Review the output video with overlays for performance insights.

Future Enhancements
Integration of advanced ball spin and speed calculations calibrated to physical measurements.

Expansion of shot-type detection and automated coaching suggestions.

Addition of personalized training plans based on analytics.

Capability to track players and racket movements alongside the ball.

Support for community features such as data sharing and remote coaching.

Contribution
Contributions to improve ball detection accuracy, add new analytic features, or enhance usability are welcome.
