🏓 Table Tennis Trainer – AI-Powered Ball Detection & Analytics

📌 Overview
Table Tennis Trainer is an AI-powered system that detects, tracks, and analyzes table tennis balls from gameplay videos.
By combining deep learning (via Roboflow API) and traditional computer vision techniques, it provides trajectory mapping, ball speed insights, and performance metrics — helping players improve through data-driven feedback.

✨ Features
🎯 AI-Powered Ball Detection – Frame-by-frame ball detection via Roboflow object detection API.

🖼 Video Overlays – Bounding boxes, ball trajectories, and key metrics overlaid on gameplay footage.

🛠 Fallback CV Tracking – Color segmentation, contour detection, and trajectory mapping for robust tracking without AI.

📊 Performance Metrics – Estimated ball speed, spin (future), and control analysis.

🧩 Modular & Extensible – Easy to integrate new features such as racket tracking, shot classification, or coaching tips.

📹 Match & Practice Support – Analyze both training sessions and competitive games.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.9+ – Core programming language

OpenCV – Video processing & image analysis

Roboflow API – AI-based object detection

NumPy & Pandas – Data handling

JSON – Storing detection results

⚙️ How It Works
Upload Video – Input your table tennis gameplay footage.

AI Detection – Frames are sent to the Roboflow API to detect the ball’s position.

Post-Processing – Extracts coordinates, calculates metrics, and applies trajectory smoothing.

Overlay Creation – Generates an annotated video showing detections, paths, and statistics.

Review & Improve – Use the visual data to refine your gameplay.

🚀 Installation
